  "body": "Ahead of the Summit, a cohort of patients from the European Lung Foundation’s patient organisation network responded to a survey that asked about what currently affects their care. The Summit agenda was developed to address the needs and trends identified in the patient survey, through multi-stakeholder discussion, breakout sessions and patient testimonials.\r\n\r\nA number of patient advocates and respiratory experts were invited to present on key health topics centring on the importance of incorporating the voice and priorities of patients into the design and delivery high-quality care systems. The agenda was led by patients, and featured a number of individuals telling their personal stories to contribute to the debate on the future of patient care.\r\n\r\nThe Summit opened with remarks from Professor Gaga, which set the scene in terms of future threats and current solutions to healthcare in Europe. Professor Gaga said: “We must work closely together, all stakeholders, in order to deliver best care, meet the patients' needs and organise health care in an effective, accessible and cost-efficient way, with a human face.”\r\n\r\nEU Commissioner Vytenis Andriukaitis delivered a video message to the Summit on the policy-level challenges towards achieving good lung health across Europe, highlighting outdoor air pollution, tobacco control and social factors as barriers. \r\n\r\nChair of ELF, Isabel Saraiva, then presented results of the patient’s trend survey. Overall, the survey found that patients are optimistic about the future, concluding that they hope to: live longer than ever before and will benefit from personalised medicines; embrace new technologies, which may speed up diagnosis and allow patients to more easily monitor their conditions; have better access to medical advice from healthcare professionals using online tools; and they expect the public to have a better understanding of what damages the lungs.\r\n\r\nThe two-day event focused on a number of key themes – with the main programme beginning with a session on multidisciplinary and specialist care, which discussed how this should be managed to improve patient outcomes. Panellists concluded that key priorities for ensuring effective interdisciplinary care must focus on good collaboration, education and communication, and incorporating treatment in to the daily lives of patients.\r\n\r\nThe following session considered issues related to multi-morbidities and the ageing population, in which Professor Anita Simonds highlighted the need for better education around palliative and end of life care. Panellists suggested the term “end of life” could shift to “advance care planning” in order to reduce stigma, and proposed that patient organisations could better bridge the gap between healthcare professionals and patients, by providing education on the topic to ensure truly patient-centred care. \r\n\r\nPresentations also discussed the financing of new advances in medical care in light of growing economic inequalities, with particular focus upon the current situation in Greece, offering insightful perspectives on the complexities of financing healthcare and medicines to make them accessible for patients.\r\n\r\nFollowing the presentations, speakers and attendees were invited to take part in breakout sessions in which they collaboratively developed solutions to the challenges raised in ELF patient’s survey. The outcomes of these deliberations are currently being revised and finalised, and will be followed up in due course.\r\n\r\nThe final day of the Summit focused on lung cancer, with sessions on prevention and early diagnosis; the future of lung cancer care and treatment; and personalised medicines. It included powerful testimonies from patient advocates and discussion around screening for lung cancer and the future of diagnosis and treatment in the condition. A popular proposal was for the development of European guidelines on lung cancer screening, as well as the integration of smoking cessation into screening programmes.\r\n\r\nThe outcomes from the discussions held at the Summit aim to pinpoint potential solutions to the barriers identified in the patients’ survey, and will be developed into advocacy points for the future of patient care and published in the European Respiratory Journal as a special EU lung corner.\r\n\r\nFollowing the event, Professor Gaga said: “These have been two extraordinary days! Knowing the scientific data and clinical guidelines is imperative but it is patients who put a face to disease, give us a new perspective and allow us to get the true measure of the problems and the impact of the solutions. They give us the empathy we need to try harder and to get better. \r\n\r\n“The summit has been an open dialogue with patients, doctors, policymakers, the pharmaceutical and medical technology industry, all stakeholders. And it has been both scientific but also out of the box and moving. This is how we can move forward, together.\r\n\r\n“Our immediate goal is to publish the discussions and outcomes and raise awareness, and also to specifically push for lung cancer screening as it reduces mortality from lung cancer, and when used with clear algorithms, it is not only life-saving but also cost-effective, as proven in studies from the US and Canada.”\r\n\r\n* [Access the presentations and other resources](https://www.ersnet.org/congress-and-events/ers-presidential-summits/redesigning-the-future-of-patient-care)\r\n* [See how the event unfolded on Twitter](https://twitter.com/i/moments/1009002501788590080)\r\n",

  "shortLead": "Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is associated with changes to the structure of the brain that are also seen in the early stages of dementia,...",
  "body": "The researchers worked with a group of 83 people, aged between 51 and 88 years, who had visited their doctor with concerns over their memory or mood but had no OSA diagnosis. Each participant was assessed for their memory skills and symptoms of depression, and each was given an MRI scan to measure the dimensions of different areas of the brain.\r\n\r\nParticipants also attended a sleep clinic where they were monitored overnight for signs of OSA using polysomnography. \r\n\r\nThe researchers found that patients who had low levels of oxygen in their blood while they were sleeping tended to have reduced thickness in the left and right temporal lobes of the brain. \r\n\r\nThey also found that this alteration in the brain was linked with participant's poorer ability to learn new information. The researchers say this is the first time a direct link of this kind has been shown.\r\n\r\nConversely, patients with signs of OSA were also more likely to have increased thickness in other regions of the brain, which the researchers say could be signs of the brain reacting to lower levels of oxygen with swelling and inflammation.\r\n\r\nThe study was led by Professor Sharon Naismith from the University of Sydney, Australia. She said: \"Our results suggest that we should be screening for OSA in older people. We should also be asking older patients attending sleep clinics about their memory and thinking skills, and carrying out tests where necessary.\r\n\r\n\"There is no cure for dementia so early intervention is key. On the other hand, we do have an effective treatment for OSA. This research shows that diagnosing and treating OSA could be an opportunity to prevent cognitive decline before it's too late.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Naismith and her team are now working on research to find out whether CPAP treatment can prevent further cognitive decline and improve brain connectivity in patients with mild cognitive impairment.\r\n\r\nAndrea Aliverti, Professor of Bioengineering at Politecnico di Milano, Italy, is Head of the European Respiratory Society's Assembly on Clinical Physiology and Sleep and was not involved in the research. He said: \"We already know that as well as disrupting sleep, OSA can increase the risk of high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, heart attack and stroke. This research adds to evidence that OSA is also linked to dementia and suggests a likely mechanism for the link. However, we can treat OSA and measures such as stopping smoking and losing weight can reduce the risk of developing the condition.\"\r\n\r\n* [Access the article](http://erj.ersjournals.com/content/52/1/1800740) ",

  "leadParagraph": "Florence Nightingale (1820-1910) was a forerunner of nursing practice and an exponent of evidence-based nursing. She came from a privileged background but as a woman in the Victorian era and as a nurse encountered certain challenges. Later in her career, she proposed a potential appointment as a chair at Oxford University to teach applied statistics and was prepared to contribute £200. It will remain unclear as to why this did not progress – whether it was because her proposal was misunderstood or whether her profession as a nurse or being a woman was indeed an obstacle<sup>1</sup>.  A century and a half on, this blog considers how the nursing profession has evolved and the challenges it faces in the 21st century.",
  "shortLead": "Florence Nightingale (1820-1910) was a forerunner of nursing practice and an exponent of evidence-based nursing. She came from a privileged...",
  "body": "Nightingale’s leadership style was knowledge-based and evolved to a point in time where she developed and led a team of doctors, a major statistician, two engineers (one army and one civil), and learned research skills including the application of statistical methods. This suggests that neither gender nor profession were a barrier to leadership. Today there are a number of Professors in nursing who lead multidisciplinary clinical research teams, but the growth of this model has been relatively slow. \r\n\r\nLeadership is a core element of nursing practice – many nurses positively influence nursing practice and patient care with humility at the ground level through understated and sadly often unrecognised leadership. To lead and influence at a senior level nurses have had to make a choice. Over the last few decades, career progression in nursing in the clinical setting has been into service management roles; increasingly removed from direct patient care. Educational leadership has involved moving into the higher education setting. \r\n\r\nPure nursing academic leadership has evolved more slowly, due in part to a lack of clearly defined academic career pathways in nursing. In the UK this may also be influenced by disproportionate nurse representation at the universities within the ‘golden triangle’, which attract the highest research incomes of all British universities, but focus on scientific disciplines outside of nursing.  \r\n\r\nNightingale was an innovator and academic leader in nursing. She has been described as a systemic thinker and a “passionate statistician”. A pioneer in the visual presentation of information and statistical graphics, Nightingale was credited with developing a form of the pie chart now known as the polar area diagram.  Knowledge of statistics and applied statistics could have a prominent place in the contemporary nurse training curricula. A lack of understanding of statistics can be a barrier to effectively critiquing research and to developing one’s own. Many nurses, like Nightingale, are self-taught in the use of statistics.\r\n\r\nOver the last 15 years Advanced Practitioners and Nurse Consultants have pushed through traditional medical / nursing boundaries and have been pioneers of independent practice. In the community some traditional general practices have been replaced by nurse led services employing salaried GPs, and in the hospital setting there are many nurse led clinics providing specialist care. These hybrid roles integrate clinical, educational and research practice underpinned by leadership skills.\r\n\r\nCombining clinical-academic roles requires intellectual stimulation to encourage questioning, and to challenge the status quo in order to continue to evolve. This may be achieved through engagement with professional organisations and / or formal academic study.  \r\n\r\nFunding streams specifically to support nurses in their academic career development are available for example through the National institute of Health Research<sup>2</sup>. ERS Fellowships offer short-term funding and are under-utilised by nursing members of the ERS. To access these successfully there is a need for training and support in how-to write a good funding application, and more nursing academics to support and supervise primary research.  Training in research and financial management should not be overlooked. Collaborating across disciplines and Europe can strengthen a funding application.\r\n\r\nOur recent paper in the ERS publication, *Breathe*, considered the contemporary challenges for specialist nurses working in interstitial lung disease (ILD)<sup>3</sup>. The development of ILD specific clinical and academic standards to sustain and expand a dedicated ILD workforce was called for. Many ILDs are associated with high morbidity and mortality, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), which has a marginally better prognosis than lung cancer<sup>4</sup>. There is an emotional burden attached to supporting patients and families with life limiting conditions such as these.  It is often the nurse who is both the first and continuing point of contact. For example, a clinical nursing colleague running her own clinics reviews 20 ‘dying’ patients every week. This potentially exposes nurses to high levels of emotional stress, as the therapeutic alliance is unlikely to be wholly objective.\r\n\r\nNightingale must have experienced distressing situations in the Crimean war. Whilst being forward thinking in applying a health-related outcome measure for her patients, the fact that it had only three-points: relieved; unrelieved; and dead<sup>5</sup>, reflects the gravity of that time.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the data she collected and analysed reported an annual mortality rate of 60% for soldiers in civilian and military hospitals<sup>1</sup>. This informed changes in practice, and led to improvements in health care practice and a decline in preventable deaths.\r\n\r\nIn the ILD specialism we are working with life limiting conditions for which there may not be a cure. Caring is a fundamental aspect of nursing but it can be all consuming and detract from objective critical thought, and can impact the time and intellectual capacity for professional development. Emulating Nightingale’s pragmatic approach, we need to question specifically what is important to the nurse-patient consultation, and are we making a quantifiable difference? This will inform relevant research questions and audit, enabling us to continually re-evaluate and improve patient care. \r\n\r\nThankfully our contemporary approach to measuring patient reported outcomes is more sophisticated, but it is important to discuss the outcomes recorded by the patient with the patient, to plan for future care and open up discussion on palliation and transitions to end of life care where appropriate. \r\n\r\nThere are a number of ILD nurses who work at advanced practice or nurse consultant level, with the majority fulfilling roles as specialist nurses. We do have some ILD specific clinical standards and pathways of care for patients; the Royal College of Nursing in the UK offers a credentialing programme for advanced practice that provides one approach to define parameters of practice<sup>6</sup>.But standards to develop and support clinical-academic career pathways are lacking. \r\n\r\nFor senior nurses working in ILD there is a responsibility to provide a role model for the behaviours they wish to instil in others, and to inspire and motivate others to achieve their potential within the specialism. To support professional growth, the ILD Inter-disciplinary Network has launched a no-cost UK and European mentorship programme for nurses working in ILD. Mentorship provides the opportunity to explore the challenges of balancing a clinical-academic career. Most importantly, it offers time out to think; an art that is often compromised in our technology filled lives.\r\n\r\nNightingale decided how best to use her time and energy according to the best available evidence. There is merit in this approach, not least because it requires thought. The clinical-academic pathway taken by Nightingale was not without its challenges. Whilst challenges remain in contemporary nursing practice we have moved on, but we must make more of the opportunities on offer and continue to create our own to cement progress. \r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n#### About the author\r\n\r\nAnne-Marie Russell is a clinical research fellow at the National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London.
